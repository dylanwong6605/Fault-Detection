##  Project Objectives

- Preprocess and analyze data from the UR3 CobotOps dataset
- Extract meaningful features for fault classification
- Build machine learning models to detect abnormal robot operations
- Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Provide interpretable insights for predictive maintenance

##  Dataset Description

The **UR3 CobotOps dataset** consists of sensor data collected from a UR3 robotic arm, typically including:

- Joint torque values
- Angular positions and velocities
- Fault injection conditions
- Time-series operational signals
